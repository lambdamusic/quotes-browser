						<p><p>Your identity emerges out of your habits. [...] More precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person. When you train each day, you embody the identity of an athletic person.
The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originally derived from the Latin words 'essentitas', which means being, and 'identidem', which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.”</p></p>

						<p><p>Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It transforms a personal quest into a shared one. Previously, you were on your own. Your identity was singular. You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athlete. When you join a book club or a band or a cycling group, your identity becomes linked to those around you. Growth and change is no longer an individual pursuit. We are readers. We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits.</p></p>

						</small>

					<blockquote class="-quote-block">
						<p><p>The more sacred an idea is to us—that is, the more deeply it is tied to our identity—the more strongly we will defend it against criticism. You see this in every industry. The schoolteacher who ignores innovative teaching methods and sticks with her tried-and-true lesson plans. The veteran manager who is committed to doing things “his way.” The surgeon who dismisses the ideas of her younger colleagues. The band who produces a mind-blowing first album and then gets stuck in a rut. The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.
One solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are. In the words of investor Paul Graham, “keep your identity small.” The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you. If you tie everything up in being the point guard or the partner at the firm or whatever else, then the loss of that facet of your life will wreck you. If you’re a vegan and then develop a health condition that forces you to change your diet, you’ll have an identity crisis on your hands. When you cling too tightly to one identity, you become brittle. Lose that one thing and you lose yourself.</p></p>

					</legend>

					<blockquote class="-quote-block">
						<p><p>If your identity is wrapped up in a belief like “I’m a great soldier,” what happens when your period of service ends? For many business owners, their identity is something along the lines of “I’m the CEO” or “I’m the founder.” If you have spent every waking moment working on your business, how will you feel after you sell the company?
The key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine yourself such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your particular role changes.
- “I’m an athlete” becomes “I’m the type of person who is mentally tough and loves a physical challenge.”
- “I’m a great soldier” transforms into “I’m the type of person who is disciplined, reliable, and great on a team.”
- “I’m the CEO” translates to “I’m the type of person who builds and creates things.”
When chosen effectively, an identity can be flexible rather than brittle. Like water flowing around an obstacle, your identity works with the changing circumstances rather than against them.</p></p>

						<p><p>If you procrastinate and put your project off until tomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later. A single decision is easy to dismiss.
But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there— that eventually leads to a problem.
The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff—the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet— but when magnified across the entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles apart.</p></p>

						<p><p>Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it. Your habits are just a series of automatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly. As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”
As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else. When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what to look for. There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that. These cognitive scripts can be followed automatically whenever the situation is appropriate. Now, whenever you feel stressed, you get the itch to run. As soon as you walk in the door from work, you grab the video game controller. A choice that once required effort is now automatic. A habit has been created.</p></p>

						<p><p>This process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent. The MTA subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that is “point-only,” and “within two years of implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.”
Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. Because the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are more likely to notice problems before something goes wrong.
[...]
One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing. This helps explain why the consequences of bad habits can sneak up on us. We need a “point-and- call” system for our personal lives. That’s the origin of the Habits Scorecard, which is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior. To create your own, make a list of your daily habits [...] Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself, “Is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?” If it is a good habit, write “+” next to it. If it is a bad habit, write “–”. If it is a neutral habit, write “=”.</p></p>

						</small>
					</legend>

					<blockquote class="-quote-block">
						<p><p>The French philosopher Denis Diderot lived nearly his entire life in poverty, but that all changed one day in 1765.
Diderot’s daughter was about to be married and he could not afford to pay for the wedding. Despite his lack of wealth, Diderot was well known for his role as the co-founder and writer of Encyclopédie, one of the most comprehensive encyclopedias of the time. When Catherine the Great, the Empress of Russia, heard of Diderot’s financial troubles, her heart went out to him. She was a book lover and greatly enjoyed his encyclopedia. She offered to buy Diderot’s personal library for £1,000 —more than $150,000 today.* Suddenly, Diderot had money to spare. With his new wealth, he not only paid for the wedding but also acquired a scarlet robe for himself.
Diderot’s scarlet robe was beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that he immediately noticed how out of place it seemed when surrounded by his more common possessions. He wrote that there was “no more coordination, no more unity, no more beauty” between his elegant robe and the rest of his stuff.
Diderot soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions. He replaced his rug with one from Damascus. He decorated his home with expensive sculptures. He bought a mirror to place above the mantel, and a better kitchen table. He tossed aside his old straw chair for a leather one. Like falling dominoes, one purchase led to the next.
Diderot’s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.</p></p>

						<p><p>Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable. Many people select cues that are too vague. I made this mistake myself. When I wanted to start a push-up habit, my habit stack was “When I take a break for lunch, I will do ten push-ups.” At first glance, this sounded reasonable. But soon, I realized the trigger was unclear. Would I do my push-ups before I ate lunch? After I ate lunch? Where would I do them? After a few inconsistent days, I changed my habit stack to: “When I close my laptop for lunch, I will do ten push-ups next to my desk.” Ambiguity gone.
Habits like “read more” or “eat better” are worthy causes, but these goals do not provide instruction on how and when to act. Be specific and clear: After I close the door. After I brush my teeth. After I sit down at the table. The specificity is important. The more tightly bound your new habit is to a specific cue, the better the odds are that you will notice when the time comes to act.</p></p>

					<blockquote class="-quote-block">
						<p><p>On the first day of class, Jerry Uelsmann, a professor at the University of Florida, divided his film photography students into two groups. Everyone on the left side of the classroom, he explained, would be in the “quantity” group. They would be graded solely on the amount of work they produced. On the final day of class, he would tally the number of photos submitted by each student. One hundred photos would rate an A, ninety photos a B, eighty photos a C, and so on.
Meanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the “quality” group. They would be graded only on the excellence of their work. They would only need to produce one photo during the semester, but to get an A, it had to be a nearly perfect image.
At the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best photos were produced by the quantity group. During the semester, these students were busy taking photos, experimenting with composition and lighting, testing out various methods in the darkroom, and learning from their mistakes. In the process of creating hundreds of photos, they honed their skills. Meanwhile, the quality group sat around speculating about perfection. In the end, they had little to show for their efforts other than unverified theories and one mediocre photo.*
It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.”</p></p>

Unfortunately, the environments where we live and work often make it easy not to do certain actions because there is no obvious cue to trigger the behavior. It’s easy not to practice the guitar when it’s tucked away in the closet. It’s easy not to read a book when the bookshelf is in the corner of the guest room. It’s easy not to take your vitamins when they are out of sight in the pantry. When the cues that spark a habit are subtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.
[...]
If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues. Consider how many different ways a smoker could be prompted to pull out a cigarette: driving in the car, seeing a friend smoke, feeling stressed at work, and so on.
The same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you’ll think about your habit throughout the day.</p></p>

Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad.

Worrying about your health makes you feel anxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety, which makes your health even worse and soon you’re feeling more anxious.

If you grow up in a family that rewards you for your chess skills, playing chess will seem like a very attractive thing to do. If you work in a job where everyone wears expensive suits, then you’ll be inclined to splurge on one as well. If all of your friends are sharing an inside joke or using a new phrase, you’ll want to do it, too, so they know that you “get it.” Behaviors are attractive when they help us fit in. We imitate the habits of three groups in particular: 1. The close. 2. The many. 3. The powerful.</p></p>

Humans are similar. There is tremendous internal pressure to comply with the norms of the group. The reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.</p></p>

You have to cook dinner for your family.
Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to. You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.
The key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to do those things, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence for whatever mind-set we choose.</p></p>

What is immediately punished is avoided.
[...] Here’s the problem: most people know that delaying gratification is the wise approach. [...] Thankfully, it’s possible to train yourself to delay gratification—but you need to work with the grain of human nature, not against it.

						<p><p>It is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it. Buying a new jacket is fine if you’re trying to lose weight or read more books, but it doesn’t work if you’re trying to budget and save money. [...] Similarly, if your reward for exercising is eating a bowl of ice cream, then you’re casting votes for conflicting identities, and it ends up being a wash. Instead, maybe your reward is a massage, which is both a luxury and a vote toward taking care of your body. Now the short-term reward is aligned with your long-term vision of being a healthy person. 
Eventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy, and reduced stress kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing the secondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You do it because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.</p></p>

						</small>
					</legend>

					<blockquote class="-quote-block">
						<p><p>A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit. The most basic format is to get a calendar and cross off each day you stick with your routine. For example, if you meditate on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, each of those dates gets an X. As time rolls by, the calendar becomes a record of your habit streak.
Countless people have tracked their habits, but perhaps the most famous was Benjamin Franklin. Beginning at age twenty, Franklin carried a small booklet everywhere he went and used it to track thirteen personal virtues. This list included goals like “Lose no time. Be always employed in something useful” and “Avoid trifling conversation.” At the end of each day, Franklin would open his booklet and record his progress.</p></p>

						</small>
					</legend>

					<blockquote class="-quote-block">
						<p><p>The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it. If your success is measured by quarterly earnings, you will optimize sales, revenue, and accounting for quarterly earnings. If your success is measured by a lower number on the scale, you will optimize for a lower number on the scale, even if that means embracing crash diets, juice cleanses, and fat-loss pills. The human mind wants to “win” whatever game is being played.
This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working long hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about getting ten thousand steps than we do about being healthy. We teach for standardized tests instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity, and critical thinking. In short, we optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.
This is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system.</p></p>

						<p><p>The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition. This is just as true with habit change as it is with sports and business. Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities. Like Michael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on the track, you want to play a game where the odds are in your favor.
Embracing this strategy requires the acceptance of the simple truth that people are born with different abilities. Some people don’t like to discuss this fact. On the surface, your genes seem to be fixed, and it’s no fun to talk about things you cannot control. Plus, phrases like biological determinism makes it sound like certain individuals are destined for success and others doomed to failure. But this is a shortsighted view of the influence of genes on behavior.
The strength of genetics is also their weakness. Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. If you want to dunk a basketball, being seven feet tall is very useful. If you want to perform a gymnastics routine, being seven feet tall is a great hindrance. Our environment determines the suitability of our genes and the utility of our natural talents. When our environment changes, so do the qualities that determine success.</p></p>

As physician Gabor Mate notes, “Genes can predispose, but they don’t predetermine.” The areas where you are genetically predisposed to success are the areas where habits are more likely to be satisfying. The key is to direct your effort toward areas that both excite you and match your natural skills, to align your ambition with your ability.</p></p>

						</small>
					</legend>

					<blockquote class="-quote-block">
						<p><p>How do we design habits that pull us in rather than ones that fade away? Scientists have been studying this question for many years. While there is still much to learn, one of the most consistent findings is that the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of “just manageable difficulty.”
The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty. If you love tennis and try to play a serious match against a four-year-old, you will quickly become bored. It’s too easy. You’ll win every point. In contrast, if you play a professional tennis player like Roger Federer or Serena Williams, you will quickly lose motivation because the match is too difficult.
Now consider playing tennis against someone who is your equal. As the game progresses, you win a few points and you lose a few. You have a good chance of winning, but only if you really try. Your focus narrows, distractions fade away, and you find yourself fully invested in the task at hand. This is a challenge of just manageable difficulty and it is a prime example of the Goldilocks Rule.
The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.</p></p>

They found that to achieve a state of flow, a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your current ability. In real life it’s typically not feasible to quantify the difficulty of an action in this way, but the core idea of the Goldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of just manageable difficulty—something on the perimeter of your ability— seems crucial for maintaining motivation.</p></p>

The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us. The outcome becomes expected. And as our habits become ordinary, we start derailing our progress to seek novelty. Perhaps this is why we get caught up in a never-ending cycle, jumping from one workout to the next, one diet to the next, one business idea to the next. As soon as we experience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin seeking a new strategy—even if the old one was still working.

The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to little errors. You assume you’re getting better because you’re gaining experience. In reality, you are merely reinforcing your current habits—not improving them.

<li>The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
    Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.
    Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.
    Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.
    An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.</li>
<li>How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
    There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.
    The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
    Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
    Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
    The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.</li>
<li>How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
    A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.
    The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.
    Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.
    The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.</li>

						</small>
					</legend>

					<blockquote class="-quote-block">
						<p><ol>
<li>The Man Who Didn’t Look Right
    With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.
    Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.
    The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.
    Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.
    The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.</li>
<li>The Best Way to Start a New Habit
    The 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious.
    The two most common cues are time and location.
    Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location.
    The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].
    Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.
    The habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].</li>
<li>Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More 7 The Secret to Self-Control
    Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time.
    Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.
    Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.
    Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue.
    It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.</li>
<li>The Secret to Self-Control
    The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible.
    Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.
    People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it.
    One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.
    Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.</li>

						</small>
					</legend>

					<blockquote class="-quote-block">
						<p><ol>
<li>How to Make a Habit Irresistible
    The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive.
    The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.
    Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.
    It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.
    Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.</li>
<li>The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits 10 How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits
    The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us.
    We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.
    We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige).
    One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.
    The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.
    If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.</li>
<li>How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits
    The inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it unattractive.
    Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive.
    Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.
    The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling.
    Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive.
    Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.</li>

						</small>
					</legend>

					<blockquote class="-quote-block">
						<p><ol>
<li>Walk Slowly, but Never Backward
    The 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy.
    The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.
    Focus on taking action, not being in motion.
    Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition.
    The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.</li>
<li>The Law of Least Effort
    Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.
    Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy.
    Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult.
    Prime your environment to make future actions easier.</li>
<li>How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule
    Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward.
    Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one.
    The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”
    The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.
    Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.</li>
<li>How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible
    The inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it difficult.
    A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future.
    The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits.
    Onetime choices—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.
    Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior.</li>

						</small>
					</legend>

					<blockquote class="-quote-block">
						<p><ol>
<li>
<p>The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change
    The 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying.
    We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying.
    The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.
    The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.
    To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful— even if it’s in a small way.
    The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change —make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day
    One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress.
    A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar.
    Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress.
    Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.
    Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible.
    Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything
    The inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it unsatisfying.
    We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying.
    An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us.
    A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful.
    Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator.</p>

						</small>

					<blockquote class="-quote-block">
						<p><ol>
<li>The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t)
    The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition.
    Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle.
    Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances.
    Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose the habits that best suit you.
    Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can’t find a game that favors you, create one.
    Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.</li>
<li>The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work 
    The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.
    The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.
    As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored.
    Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference.
    Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.</li>
<li>The Downside of Creating Good Habits
    The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.
    Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
    Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time.
    The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.</li>
